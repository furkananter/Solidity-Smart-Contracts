    Truffle is a powerful development environment and a test framework. 
    It uses JavaScript, web3.js, faucet plugins and blockchain forking technologies. 
    Since you need a local blockchain, it is commonly used with Ganache tool.
    Truffle can be easily integrated with its tools like Drizzle and Ganache. 
    Ganache in particular is one of the most popular ways for engineers to run a local blockchain for Ethereum development and is available as a command-line tool or desktop application. 
    Blockchain developers can use Ganache for deploying smart contracts and performing tests.
    The Ganache tool has a user-friendly interface where you can access debugging information and blockchain data (accounts, blocks, transactions). 
    You can also configure other elements, such as block times, based on your development needs.
